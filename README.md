## AIM
To study and implement 2 Dimensional arrays in C++

## Software Used 
VS Code

## Theory
A 2D array is a data structure that with a grid, where each element is identified by two indices: a row index and a column index.  

```cpp
int matrix[3][4] = {
    {1, 2, 3, 4},
    {5, 6, 7, 8},
    {9, 10, 11, 12}
};
```

**Features of 2D array:**  

- Structure: A 2D array is essentially an array of arrays, where each element of the outer array is another array representing a row in the matrix.
- Indexing: Elements in a 2D array are accessed using two indices.
- Contiguous Memory: In C++, a 2D array is stored in memory as a continuous block of memory.
- Operations: Various operations can be performed on 2D arrays, including addition, subtraction, and multiplication (in the case of matrices).

**Uses of 2D Arrays:**  

 * Used in applications including computer graphics, image processing.
 * Used  in scientific simulations, spreadsheets.
 * Used in mathematical representation of matrix.
   eg-
   
 | 1 | 2 | 3 |
|---|---|---|
| 4 | 5 | 6 |
| 7 | 8 | 9 |

## Conclusion
We learnt about the use cases of 2 dimensional matrices in C++.
